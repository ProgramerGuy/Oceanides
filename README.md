Our mission is to be the connection between sponsors and ideas 🧠, helping them to create scalable solutions that have a social and personal impact. For that, we created a web project that helps us connect them, take our users ideas and show our work through our gallery and projects. 
Allowing users or sponsors to contribute and become partners with our community or with a project that can take new requests.
